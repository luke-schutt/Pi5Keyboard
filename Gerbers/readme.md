# Gerbers!

Here you can find gerbers and revision history for the Pi5 Keyboard. Git commits are used for the KiCad revisions so if needed checkout the correct commit and make any desired modifications from that.

## Revision 1

Note: _This revision has **not** been tested!_

Revision 1 moves the PCB mounting holes to match the Raspberry Pi Pico's mounting holes and the reset button was moved a bit. Slots for diodes are added to the mounting plate. Holes were moved on the microcontroller cover.

The revision 0 mounting plate is compatible if slots for the diodes aren't desired, however it does have two mounting holes that aren't present. The microcontroller cover was retroactively created for revision 0 with mounting holes matching the Raspberry Pi Pico. Because of this it is also compatible with either design, however the two additional mounting holes were removed and the reset button hole was shifted to match revision 1.

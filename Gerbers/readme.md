# Gerbers!

Here you can find gerbers and revision history for the Pi5 Keyboard. Git commits are used for the KiCad revisions so if needed checkout the correct commit and make any desired modifications from that.

## Revision 1

Note: _This revision has **not** been tested!_

Revision 1 moves the PCB mounting holes to match the Raspberry Pi Pico's mounting holes. Slots for for diodes are added to the mounting plate. The revision 0 mounting plate is compatible if slots for the diodes aren't desired, however it does have two mounting holes that aren't present.
